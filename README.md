# Lit Master Node Demo Project

**Read the official [Blog Post](LINK HERE)**

**This Project is intended to work with Unity release [2013.3](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update).**

With the release of 2018.3, Shader Graph introduces a new Master Node for the High Definition Render Pipeline. 
This new Master Node (called Lit Master) makes many of the advanced shading features found in HDRP accessible in Shader Graph!

This demo project makes use of Shader Graph and the High Definition Render Pipeline. It contains a bonsai tree and butterfly to showcase using iridescence 
and translucency with shadergraph.

For additional example projects check out Andy Touch’s [Shader Graph Example Library](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/ShaderGraph_ExampleLibrary)!

If you want to talk to us about the Shader Graph, check out the [forums](https://forum.unity.com/threads/feedback-wanted-shader-graph.511960/) and stay tuned to the blog for more exciting updates!

**Bugs**: If when first launching shaders look incorrect (such as the butterfly being flat blue) open the associated Shader Graph (all shader graphs in the folder ShaderGraphShaders) and click the **Save Asset** button in the top left of the Shader Graph Window.

**Note**: this project demos multiple features that are still in Preview, meaning they introduce brand new features and workflows. As such, some of these features may be subject to change (API, UX, scope, etc.) and aren’t covered by traditional Unity support. 
You can, however, report issues with Preview features on our [forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/graphics-experimental-previews.110/?_ga=2.75910933.1446511377.1522795261-1647295365.1509665782) page.
